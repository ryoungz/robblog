                <p>I was one of two front-end developers on the Value Added Services re-brand, working with a small team of talented Augeo designers. I was integral to the development process throughout the project and was lead developer on the internal development team.</p>

                <p>An object-oriented approach was adopted for the interface toolkit to ensure that CSS was efficient, predictable and easily maintainable. The ability to toggle HTML/CSS information regarding the various standardized components was baked into the toolkit to help the development team.</p>
