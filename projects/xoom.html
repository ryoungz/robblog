            <p>Web redesign to move the XOOM Xtras site to a more interactive and multimedia centered experience that included both daily games and auctions. The main issue our team faced was to provide a sleek and fun look in a harmonic interface design. </p>

                <p>Sole front-end developer on the XOOM Energy redesign, working alongside a small team of back-end developers and talented Augeo designers. I was integral to the development process throughout the project and was lead developer for internal development.</p>

                <p>We used Bootstrap as a foundation primarily to leverage its grid system. Site pages are built with the TWIG template engine. This allowed us to break pages down into distinct content modules for better organization. </p>
