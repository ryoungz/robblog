I'm going to just put this out there—I'm an unabashed Android fan. I bleed green. My first smart phone was a DROID Incredible. It was a workhorse, still runs well, and now performs dutifully as testing hardware on my mobile development workbench.

Enter the Moto X

It may not be the top of the line where hardware specs are concerned, but the Moto X's carefully optimized custom eight-core system-on-a-chip processor along with a focus on user experience make it a very compelling piece of hardware. The fact that they fit a 4.7” 720p display in a smaller form factor doesn't hurt either. And of course the case customization can't be ignored. Although I don't see myself purchasing a smart phone with a crazy colored back plate, I do foresee hours wasted viewing all the combinations on the MotoMaker site.

So thanks Motorola for getting me excited about a new phone again. I'll be waiting patiently for the rumored 23 August release date. In the interim, I will open a new space on my mobile workbench for my faithful Galaxy Nexus in preparation for adding a dash of X to my life.
