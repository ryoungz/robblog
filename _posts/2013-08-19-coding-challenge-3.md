Search is one piece of functionality you find on almost all web pages now. This week’s challenge is a toe dip into the deep topic of search and filtering. We will build the functionality to allow users to do on page highlighting for text they enter in a search box.

jQuery, a JavaScript library, will be used to create this functionality. Once again we will break the task into small, digestible bits: 

1. We need to build a search form so users can enter in their term

2. We need some text to search through

3. Finally, we’ll write some JavaScript that gives us the search functionality.

## Search form

```javascript
Search Box:&nbsp;
<p><input id="searchterm" type="text" /></p>
```
