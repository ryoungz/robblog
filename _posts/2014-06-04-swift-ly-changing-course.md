When I first heard the news that Apple was replacing Objective-C with their new Swift programming language, I was a bit irritated. Over the past four months I had worked my way through several small projects to sharpen my Objective-C chops. I was just getting to the point where I was comfortable with the language and the Xcode environment. Now that is all out the window.

But as I thought about it a little more I started to get excited. This time I could be in on the ground floor for the new generation of iOS applications. I immediately searched for the Swift info page over at developer.apple.com. I also downloaded the free 500+ page Swift Programming Language iBook that provides a detailed reference to the language. With these two resources it’s easy to get up and running.

You know the old saying, “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.” I plan on making the sweetest lemonade out of this major shift in the iOS landscape.
