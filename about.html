            <p>Hi I'm Robert, an Interactive Developer for <a href="http://augeomarketing.com" target="_blank">Augeo Marketing</a> in St. Paul, Minnesota. I specialize in building beautifully usable web experiences for clients like US Foods and XOOM Energy.</p>
            <p>I started coding at age 7 when I built a choose your adventure program in BASIC and then fell deeper in love with programming and technology during my time in the U.S. Air Force. My passion for development pushes me to constantly learn new technologies and techniques to expand my skill setâ€”ReactJS and Gulp.js being the latest to fuel my enthusiasm. I love what I do and I believe my work is proof of that.</p>
            <p>When I am not immersed in a block of code or thumbnailing ideas for a new project, you can find me salsa dancing, digging in record store bins for vinyl, and flexing additional geek muscles over the latest comics, movies and television series.</p>
            <p><strong>Specialties:</strong> Front-end development, CSS(Sass), HTML, JavaScript, PHP, ExpressionEngine, ReactJS, and D3.js.</p>
