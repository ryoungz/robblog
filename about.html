            <p>Hi I'm Robert. I'm an Interactive Developer for <a href="http://augeomarketing.com" target="_blank">Augeo Marketing</a> in St. Paul, Minnesota. There I focus on building beautifully usable web experiences.</p>
            <p>I've been coding ever since I received my first computer on my 7th Christmas. I have a passion for development that pushes me to constantly learn new technologies and techniques to expand my skill set. I love what I do and in the end I believe my work displays that.
            </p>
            <p>When I am not immersed in a block of code or thumbnailing ideas for a new project, you will find me salsa dancing, digging in record store bins for vinyl, and geeking over the latest movies and television series.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Specialties:</strong> Front-end development, CSS(Sass), HTML, JavaScript, PHP, ExpressionEngine, ReactJS, and D3.js.</p>
